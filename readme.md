# Software User Interface Test & Education System (`suites`)

`suites` is a linux & windows application that performs automation of graphical user interface tasks.


# OS Runtime Dependencies

All operating systems: `qemu-system-x86_64[.exe]` must be available on the system `PATH`.


# General Design

`suites.exe` takes in a `.toml` file of configuration. Using this information it sets up and
runs `qemu-system-x86_64.exe` to virtualize a PC (hereafter the "VM Under Test (VUT)").
